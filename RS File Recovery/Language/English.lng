You will be able to recover information from reformatted disks and disks that have been corrupted due to a computer virus. The Wizard will help to get back data from deleted disks and files that have been deleted from the Recycle Bin or otherwise.
3=Wizard helps you restore information from corrupted, deleted, formatted and newly created partitions. During analysis the program will extract all relevant information and restore logical structure of a drive. As a result, all deleted files and catalogs will be found.
4=The recovery process is extremely simple and is accessible to any user, from advanced to novice. Just follow the instructions in the Wizard.

4=Search by manufacturer
5=Use this option if you know the manufacturer of your RAID controller. This option is also fully automatic, and it does not require you to know anything about the structure of your RAID array. This option works much faster than the first mode.
6=Manual mode
7=Use this option if you know what type of RAID you are using. In this mode, you can specify all the parameters of the RAID array manually. The program will also help you to automatically determine any parameters that you might not know. This option works faster than the previous mode.
8=Automatically detected arrays
9=The program determined that some of your hard disks had previously been part of RAID arrays. If you see your desired array in the list below, select it and click "%s" to continue.
